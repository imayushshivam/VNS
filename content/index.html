                    Varanasi (also known as Benares, Banaras, Benaras, Kashi, and Kasi) is a Hindu holy city on the
                    banks of the river Ganga (Ganges) in Uttar Pradesh.
                    <br>

                    Varanasi is to Hindus what Mecca is to Muslims and Vatican to Catholic Christians. Varanasi has a
                    unique culture, quite different from other places in the region.
                    <br>

                    This culture has developed through thousands of years during which it has been one of the major
                    cultural centres of northern India. The whole Varanasi culture revolves around the river Ganga,
                    which is the heart and soul of the city.
                    <br>
                    Varanasi has its own 'Gharanas' (style of music) in classical Indian music. Varanasi has produced
                    some of the most well-known musicians, philosophers, poets, writers in Indian history. To name a
                    few, Kabir, Munshi Premchand,Jaishankar Prasad, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Ustad Bismillah Khan were/are
                    from Varanasi.
                    <br>

                    It even has its own dialect, which is quite different from other dialects of the region. It has been
                    a seat of knowledge from about 700 BC onwards. Its universities attracted students from all over the
                    then-known world. Varanasi is also known as the Cultural Capital of India.
                    <br>

                    Mark Twain said, "Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and
                    looks twice as old as all of them put together!".

                            Named after the Hindu goddess Ganga, the Ganges River is one of the most revered natural
                            sites
                            in
                            India. The river extends southeast from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal.
                            Between
                            400 million and 600 million people rely on the Ganges River to provide water for daily
                            bathing
                            and drinking.

                            Hindus come to Varanasi from all around the world to purify themselves in the holy Ganges
                            water
                            and perform rituals along the dozens of ghats along the river. For tourists, the river helps
                            provide a fixed point of orientation for navigating around the city, and you'll no doubt
                            spend
                            lots of time sightseeing and watching life happen around the Ganges.
                        </P1>
                        <br>

                        <P1>
                            Consider waking up early and taking a sunrise cruise along the river — negotiate with one of
                            the
                            countless boatman hanging out along the ghats.

                            In the afternoon or early evening, one of the top things to do in Varanasi is purchase a
                            small
                            floating offering filled with fresh flowers and a candle, and release it onto the Ganges
                            River.
                            The blissful experience will connect you more deeply with Hindu culture and stay in your
                            mind
                            for years to come.

                            When it comes to famous places in Varanasi, the city's southernmost main ghat regularly tops
                            the
                            list. Assi Ghat's star attraction is a Shiva lingam (phallic representation of the Hindu
                            deity)
                            beneath a sacred fig tree. It draws hundreds of pilgrims every day, who come to worship Lord
                            Shiva after rinsing in the Ganges River.

                            Feeling a little stiff from traveling? Swing by Assi Ghat at sunrise, when you can get your
                            downward-facing dog on with dozens of others during morning yoga accompanied by live music
                            every
                            day. Tourists can also see another Ganga Aarti performance here in the evening, which is
                            slightly smaller and more intimate than the one at Dasaswamedh Ghat.

                            Plumes of smoke swirl toward the sky at Manikarnika Ghat. No, it's not from a factory — it's
                            from the perpetual cremations that happen on this ghat. Hindus believe that Manikarnika Ghat
                            is
                            one of the most auspicious places for the departed to reach moksha (emancipation from the
                            cycle
                            of spiritual rebirth). The funeral pyre at this ghat burns 24/7, and around 100 cremations
                            take
                            place every day.

                            Priests or guides frequently offer to lead tourists through the fascinating ghat, however
                            some
                            can be aggressive in their demands for money. You may see doms (members of an untouchable
                            caste)
                            carrying cloth-wrapped bodies on makeshift stretchers, along with piles of firewood stacked
                            up,
                            ready to feed the pyre.
                        </p3>
                        <br>
                        <p3>
                            You may also be offered the chance to see a cremation up close — for a fee, of course. While
                            profound, the experience is not for the faint of heart, nor is it a tourist attraction in
                            the
                            traditional sense. Know your limits, be respectful, and avoid taking photos of the funerals,
                            mourners, and the departed.

                            Hot tip: If you're interested in the ritualistic cremations, but can't stomach the idea of
                            seeing them up close, consider passing by Manikarnika Ghat on a boat tour along the Ganges
                            River. The distance dampens the effect while still giving tourists a sense of what's
                            happening
                            in this important place.

                            Hindu pilgrims and tourists alike travel for thousands of miles to reach the Shri Kashi
                            Vishwanath Temple, a sacred attraction around four kilometers from the Varanasi Junction
                            railway
                            station near the Manikarnika Ghat. The impressive structure, dedicated to the Hindu deity
                            Shiva,
                            has earned the nickname "The Golden Temple" for its striking spire — plated in some 800
                            kilograms of pure gold. The distinctive design of this temple has gone on to inspire the
                            architecture of hundreds of other temples across India.
                        </p4>
                        <br>

                        <p4 class="pg2"> Strict security measures around the complex require that tourists stash their
                            cameras, phones,
                            bags, and other belongings in a rentable locker nearby. Expect to ditch your shoes and wait
                            in
                            line with hundreds of other visitors, all eager to touch the 60-centimeter-tall,
                            sin-absolving
                            Shiva lingam in a silver alter. It's an intense, yet rewarding experience.

                            full
                            days to enter the temple.
